You are continuing work on an internal IT operations dashboard for a healthcare / university IT administrator.

This is a Phase 2 iteration focused on usability, prioritization, and ensuring that no critical work is missed during a busy day.

Context:
- The user handles high volumes of email, Teams messages, and tickets.
- Missed follow-ups and delayed responses are the primary risk.
- The dashboard must reduce cognitive load and make priorities obvious at a glance.
- The app already aggregates tickets, email, Teams mentions, calendar events, and system status.

Primary Goal (Non-Negotiable):
The dashboard must always answer this question clearly:
“What do I need to act on right now, and what can safely wait?”

Design Objectives:
- Transform the dashboard from a passive status view into an active decision-support system.
- Reduce noise and surface accountability.
- Adapt behavior based on time of day and task state.
- Minimize clicks and mental context switching.

Required Enhancements:

1) Time-Aware Dashboard Behavior
- The UI should change emphasis based on time context (e.g., active work hours vs end-of-day).
- During active hours, prioritize unresolved, blocking, or user-waiting items.
- Toward the end of the day, emphasize follow-ups, incomplete tasks, and items needing closure or handoff.

2) Unified Action Feed Improvements
- Each item in the feed must clearly communicate:
  - Why it matters
  - Who is waiting on whom
  - What the recommended next action is
- Items that are waiting on others should be visually de-emphasized but not lost.
- Allow intelligent snoozing that automatically resurfaces items based on events (reply received, time elapsed, SLA risk).

3) Accountability vs Awareness Separation
- Clearly distinguish between:
  - Items where the user owes action
  - Informational or FYI items
- Reduce visual competition between these two categories.

4) Priority Weighting
- Certain senders (e.g., physicians, leadership) and certain topics (e.g., Epic, Citrix, access issues) must be visually and logically prioritized.
- Urgency should be based on impact, not just timestamps.

5) Ticket Awareness Enhancements
- Replace simple ticket counts with insight-based summaries:
  - High impact
  - Near SLA
  - Waiting on user
  - Low priority
- Clicking a summary should take the user directly to the most critical subset.

6) Action Outcome Shortcuts
- Common actions (reply, acknowledge, mark waiting, convert to task/ticket) should be one-click and consistent across items.
- Actions should prepare or generate structured notes suitable for ticketing systems without forcing manual rewriting.

7) End-of-Day Confidence Check
- Provide a simple, unambiguous indicator showing whether:
  - All critical items are handled
  - Items are waiting on others
  - The user still owes action to someone

Constraints:
- Do not redesign the app from scratch.
- Build on the existing layout and visual language.
- Avoid unnecessary animations or visual clutter.
- Do not assume unrestricted admin or API access.
- Favor clarity, speed, and low mental overhead.

Deliverables:
- Updated UX structure and component behavior
- Explanation of how priorities are calculated and surfaced
- Description of how the UI adapts throughout the day
- Any assumptions or prerequisites for Phase 2 features
