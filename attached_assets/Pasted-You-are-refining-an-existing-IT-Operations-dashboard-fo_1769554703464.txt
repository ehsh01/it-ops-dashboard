You are refining an existing IT Operations dashboard for a University of Miami healthcare IT administrator.

This is NOT a redesign. The layout, structure, and core components already exist and should be preserved.
The goal is to improve clarity, speed, and confidence for a high-volume daily workflow.

Context:
- The user manages tickets, emails, Teams messages, and compliance-related tasks.
- The dashboard is used continuously throughout the day.
- The biggest risks are missed follow-ups, unclear priority, and end-of-day uncertainty.
- Visual design already uses UM colors (green and orange) and should continue to do so.

Primary Objective:
Make it immediately obvious:
1) What requires action now
2) Why it matters
3) Whether the user is “clear” or still owes action

Refinement Requirements:

1) Action Feed Tabs (Focus / Waiting / FYI)
- Make the active tab visually assertive and unmistakable.
- The active tab should feel like an execution mode.
- Inactive tabs should visually recede without disappearing.
- Do not introduce clutter or excessive animation.

2) Unified Action Feed – Priority Clarity
- Within the feed, strengthen visual hierarchy so the top 1–2 most important items stand out instantly.
- Priority indicators (SLA risk, VIP, compliance deadlines) should be more visually prominent.
- De-emphasize secondary metadata (timestamps, IDs) so the issue content dominates.

3) “Why This Matters” Context
- Each actionable feed item should clearly communicate impact at a glance.
- This can be implied visually or textually, but should reduce the need for interpretation.
- Examples of impact include:
  - Blocking multiple users
  - Compliance deadline today
  - VIP / physician waiting
  - Patient care impact

4) Daily Close Progress Panel Improvements
- Make it explicit how many items remain before the day is considered “complete.”
- Clearly indicate which remaining item(s) are blocking completion.
- Provide a strong visual confirmation state when all daily items are complete.
- This panel should give end-of-day confidence without requiring navigation elsewhere.

5) New Ticket Action Improvements
- Keep the existing “New Ticket” action.
- Improve discoverability and reduce friction when creating tickets from existing context.
- Ticket creation should feel like a natural continuation of work already visible in the dashboard.

6) Sidebar Awareness Enhancements
- Add subtle indicators (counts or visual cues) to sidebar items when new activity exists.
- These indicators should inform without distracting from the main workflow.

7) SLA Health Card Refinement
- Preserve the existing SLA health display.
- Add light contextual meaning (trend, timeframe, or recent change) without increasing complexity.
- The SLA card should communicate confidence, not raw metrics.

8) Global Status Confidence Indicator
- Introduce a small, always-visible indicator that reflects the user’s overall state:
  - All critical items handled
  - Waiting on others
  - Action still required by the user
- This indicator should reduce anxiety and remove the need to manually scan the dashboard.

Constraints:
- Do not add new major sections.
- Do not increase visual noise.
- Do not reduce information density.
- Favor clarity, hierarchy, and fast scanning over decorative elements.
- Maintain a professional healthcare / enterprise aesthetic consistent with UM branding.

Deliverables:
- Updated UX behavior and visual refinements
- Explanation of how priority and status are communicated more clearly
- Any assumptions made to support these refinements
