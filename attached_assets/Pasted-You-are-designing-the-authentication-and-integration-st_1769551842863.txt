You are designing the authentication and integration strategy for a secure internal web application used by a University of Miami IT system administrator in a healthcare environment.

Context:
- The app is a personal operational dashboard used to organize daily work.
- It aggregates signals from:
  - Microsoft Outlook (emails, replies, follow-ups)
  - Microsoft Teams (messages, mentions)
  - Calendar events
  - Ticketing/work orders (preferably via API, but email ingestion is acceptable)
- The app is NOT intended to control corporate systems directly, only to read, organize, summarize, and optionally send user-initiated replies.

Security & Compliance Constraints (Critical):
- The user’s corporate account uses Microsoft MFA (Authenticator).
- MFA must NOT be bypassed or weakened.
- No passwords may ever be stored.
- Authentication must be compatible with enterprise security, HIPAA, and university IT policies.
- The solution must avoid techniques that resemble screen scraping, headless browser automation, or background bots acting without user intent.
- All access must be permission-based, auditable, and revocable.

Auth & Identity Requirements:
- The app must authenticate the user in a way that works with Microsoft MFA.
- The user should not be prompted for MFA on every use if the platform supports secure token refresh.
- Authentication should support session-based access with proper expiration and renewal.
- The app should be capable of operating in multiple modes depending on what corporate approval is available.

Integration Scenarios to Consider:
- Best case: Admin-approved Microsoft identity integration (e.g., enterprise app / OAuth).
- Medium case: User-consented delegated access with limited scopes.
- Fallback case: Email-only ingestion and parsing when API access is restricted.
- Ticketing system may or may not expose an API; email-based ingestion must be supported as a fallback.

Functional Needs:
- Read and classify emails (urgent, action required, informational).
- Detect unanswered messages and pending follow-ups.
- Read Teams messages where the user is a participant (mentions, DMs, channels if permitted).
- Read calendar events for daily planning.
- Track ticket/work-order status via API or email correlation.
- Allow user-initiated actions (e.g., reply to email, mark task done) without automated system control.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Least-privilege access model.
- Ability to disable or revoke integrations without breaking the app.
- Clear separation between authentication, authorization, and data ingestion layers.
- Architecture should support future expansion without redesigning auth.

Your Task:
- Evaluate all viable authentication and authorization approaches that meet the above constraints.
- Identify trade-offs between security, usability, and deployment friction.
- Select the most appropriate strategy (or hybrid strategy) for this environment.
- Design the solution so it is maintainable, secure, and realistic in a corporate healthcare setting.

Do NOT:
- Provide step-by-step implementation code.
- Hardcode a single auth method without considering fallbacks.
- Assume unrestricted admin access.
- Bypass MFA or enterprise security controls.

Deliverables:
- A clear explanation of the chosen auth strategy and why it fits this user and environment.
- A description of supported fallback modes if permissions are denied.
- A high-level architecture of how authentication and integrations interact.
- Any assumptions or prerequisites that must be met for deployment.
